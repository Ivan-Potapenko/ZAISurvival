â€‹This is a kit for quickly assembling houses for use in your games. Models are in obj and fbx format, so should work with pretty much every modern game engine. It also works well with Asset Forge if you need a tool for quickly assembling the components.

You are free to use these models in any game/tool/project, and I'd love toknow if you find the kit useful. A shout-out in the credits of your project would be nice but isn't mandatory.

Any issues, or comments, please let me know.

This kit is not to be resold.
